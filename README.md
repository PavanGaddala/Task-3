# Task-3
In this task, I used SQL to extract, analyze, and manipulate data from an eCommerce database using SQLite (or mention MySQL/PostgreSQL if used). The objective was to gain practical experience with data querying techniques, relational database concepts, and analytical SQL functions.

📂 Deliverables
A .sql file containing all the executed queries

Screenshots showing the output/results of each query

🔍 What Was Done
Basic Queries: Used SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY to filter and sort data.

Joins: Performed INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN to combine data across multiple tables.

Subqueries: Wrote subqueries for advanced filtering and data extraction.

Aggregations: Used functions like SUM(), AVG(), and COUNT() for summarizing data.

Views: Created SQL views to simplify and reuse complex queries.

Indexes: Added indexes to improve the performance of specific queries.

📊 Dataset Used
Ecommerce_SQL_Database: Included tables such as customers, orders, products, and order_details.

🎓 Key Learnings
Strengthened my ability to write efficient and structured SQL queries

Understood how to combine data using joins and organize insights with grouping

Learned to optimize SQL performance using indexes

Gained confidence in using SQL as a tool for real-world data analysis
